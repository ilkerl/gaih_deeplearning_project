# Akbank Deep Learning Bootcamp: Deepfake Face Detection Project

This repository contains the project for the Akbank Deep Learning Bootcamp. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between real and AI-generated (deepfake) human faces.

## 1. Project Goal
The main objective is to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying facial images as either 'real' or 'fake'. [cite_start]This involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation, covering the end-to-end lifecycle of an image classification project[cite: 2, 3].

## 2. Dataset Information
The project uses the "Deepfake and Real Faces" dataset from Kaggle. 
- **Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kshitizbhargava/deepfake-face-images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kshitizbhargava/deepfake-face-images)
- **Content:** The dataset contains high-resolution (256x256) images of real human faces and synthetic faces generated by AI. It is pre-split into training, validation, and test sets.

## 3. Methods Used
*(This section will be filled as we progress. We will list techniques like CNN, Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning, etc.)*

## 4. Results
*(This section will be filled after model evaluation. We will summarize our model's performance metrics here.)*

## 5. Kaggle Notebook
The complete project, including all code, analysis, and visualizations, is available on Kaggle.
